# Dynamic Identity Signature (DIS) from Facial Movements
This project explores dynamic identity signatures (DIS) based on facial movements in response to humor. The project aims to evaluate the similarity between couples compared to random pairs based on these signatures.

## Methodology
- **Data Collection:** Pre-recorded videos of participants, including both couples and random pairs.
- **Smile Detection:** Using grid search with k-fold cross-validation, the smile detection model was optimized.
- **DIS Creation:** DIS metrics were created for each participant, with detailed analysis and correlation calculation.

## Next Steps
- Generalize the DIS concept beyond humor stimuli.
- Incorporate head movement analysis.
